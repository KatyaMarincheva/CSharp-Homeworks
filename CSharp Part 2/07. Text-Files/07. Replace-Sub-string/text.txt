Generally, the time to start your seeds is about 6- 8 weeks before the last expected spring frost date in your area, 
and start planting the seedlings outdoors about 2 weeks after that date. 
Another way to figure is to plan on setting out sturdy seedlings in the garden when night temperatures stay in the mid-50 degree range both day and night. 
Count back and start sowing seeds 6 to 8 weeks before that date normally arrives. If you do not feel confident about timing, 
consult an experienced gardening friend, or ask at a good garden center or seek the advice of your local Master Gardener program.
